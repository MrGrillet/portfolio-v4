        <h1>My journey</h1>

                <p class="lead">Lion! Another one. To be successful you’ve got to work hard, to make history, simple, you’ve got to make it.</p>
        <p>I grew up in Hackney, East London. I hated being in education and I decided I didn’t want to go to Uni. So, at the grand age of 19 and, with little to no resources, I started nav-poi.com.</p>

<p>The idea was to create Points of Interest that people could download onto their Sat-navs for free. Kinda like, how you use Google Maps to find the nearest restaurant or Train Station. I taught myself front-end web development to get the idea out there and, my father built the back-end.</p>

<p>We got Nav-poi to the stage where it was online and mobile friendly (in 2006!) but, with the exception of a meeting with Virgin Mobile, the idea it didn’t get far. I ended up making websites as a freelancer and, as Projects Officer for a housing association. My father went to work for Rolls Royce.</p>

<p>I had a second go at building a Startup with my father and his business partner. This project was an international money transfer business. At this point, the iPhone had recently launched and to keep operational costs low, I suggested that we make it a mobile friendly platform.</p>



<p><img src="img/red.png" class="img-right">My father and I built the web-based platform and we got the company off the ground but, after about 18 months 2008 hit. It turns out when there is a recession and people lose jobs, they stop sending money home.</p>

<h2>Then I decided to focus on marketing…</h2>
<p>When the money transfer company didn’t work out, I decided I needed to learn more about sales and marketing. I spent the next year or so, consuming every thing I could on the subjects.</p>

<p>I then went on to do freelance/ consulting for small retailers and startups like <a href="http://www.mixtapemadness.com/">Mixtape Madness</a>. Until I ended up at <a href="http://ihorizon.co.uk/">ihorizon</a> where I eventually became the head of Operations and Marketing.</p>

<p>I was the 5th person to join ihorizon and started as an intern. I was promoted several times as I was instrumental in the companies rapid growth. I was the only non-accountant leading the marketing, operations and the re-positioning of the company. In the 18 months I was there we established ourselves as the leading financial firm in London’s Tech City, grew the team to 20+ people and we multiplied the client base.</p>

<p>After ihorizon I took some time off and then decided to focus on helping more businesses scale by starting <a href="http://www.armoury.digital/">Armoury Digital</a>.</p>

<p>The aim with the Armoury was to focus on marketing funnels, not simply websites. I worked with everyone from; <a href="http://www.armoury.digital/portfolio/aqret-accounting/">Professional Services firms</a>, to <a href="http://aflete.com/">funded Startups</a>, to <a href="http://www.armoury.digital/portfolio/bespoke-binny/">boutiques</a>, to <a href="http://brotherswithnogame.com/">multi-award winning YouTube shows</a>, to <a href="http://www.armoury.digital/portfolio/aniboxx/">animation studios</a>, to speakers and fashion influencers.</p>

<p>I then went on to leverage my skill set into building a portfolio of cash generating websites and achieving the 4 Hour Work Week, which lasted for just over a year.</p>

<h3>What I do now…</h3>
<p>I have always been particularly passionate about making Statups and web based projects. I learned to code HTML/ CSS in 2006 to build a project with my father. I went on to help build a mobile first money transfer platform in 2008. I’ve built countless WordPress sites while working as a Digital Marketing Consultant.</p>

<p>More recently I have stepped back form Marketing and got back into staying up all night to find that missing semicolon. I have always been passionate about creating things and putting them online. Things have really moved on since I started, so I have been getting back up to speed and by taking on Ruby on Rails.</p>

<p>I’m now looking to join an experienced team who ship high quality projects. Ideally working with Rails or modern JS frameworks like React.</p>

<p>If you have got a project I am always happy to meet for a coffee, you never know where a conversation might go…</p>
